            I am a student in the MS MIS program at UNO.  I have worked as a Business Analyst and QA Tester for 15 years.
            I have have been married to Shoshone Cobb for 17 years and we have two children: Kennedy (14) and Wesley (11).
            We enjoy doing activities and vacations together.  I am finishing my masters to make my children proud.

            I am new to developing websites.  I am eager to learn more.
